# Project Mongo API

The assignment was to build a database with monogoDB, make some endpoints and deploy the site.

## The problem

I've had difficulties with this assignment. First I wasn't able to connect my code in vs code to Compass, and had a lot of difficulties with figuring out how to. I got help from my team mates and we figured it out. The coding went pretty okay, but the deployment of the site was really hard and I wasn't able to finish it. So this week I don't have a deployed site, yet.

## View it live

Sorry, no deployed site this week!
